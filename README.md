# Reconnaissance Suite for Spring Flows

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Vision

The Reconnaissance Suite for Spring Flows aims to offer a fully automated, scalable, and modular
reconnaissance solution. This suite leverages the power of Spring's reactive flows and modern web
technologies to create a streamlined and extensible toolkit for gathering, processing, and analyzing
reconnaissance data efficiently and effectively.

I want the Reconnaissance Suite to be super flexible so you can build your own recon workflows
however you want. By making everything modular, you can plug in different tasks—like subdomain
discovery, crawling, port scanning, or pulling OSINT data—as separate pieces that work together.
Using Spring’s features, you’ll be able to mix and match these modules to create flows that fit
exactly what you need for a job. Whether it’s adding a new step or swapping out an existing one, you
can tweak your setup on the fly without breaking anything, making it easy to adapt to different
situations.
